I dont proclaim to be a master programmer far from it. This is a tool that will automate the process of harvesting 
the NTDS.dit and SYSTEM files even on a live server. If you dont know what these files are then this is not the 
program for you ;)

It will create a folder on the C drive called "dump" (c:\dump) then use existing Windows tools to dump the files into 
the new folder.

This was only tested on a Windows Server 2012 R2. I have only tested this as an admin user but welcome feedback.
